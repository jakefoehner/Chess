# Chess
This is my personal project where I aim to implement the game of chess.

The plan to start by creating the game visually, then controlling the pieces, then check & checkmate, a gui for starting the game with different rules, and lastly an AI.

Checklist:
1. visual
2. piece movement
3. check & mate
4. game controls
5. AI
